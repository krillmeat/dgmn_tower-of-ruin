# DGMN
Always shortened to DGMN or Dgmn (for camel-case clarity in code) this Class controls an instance of a DGMN. Each DGMN starts as an Egg, and will grow as you climb the Tower, eventually returning back to an Egg, to do it all over again. Therefore, rather than a DGMN Class being the specific DGMN (Agumon, Gabumon, etc.), it should be considered the Egg for a specific Field (Dragons Roar Egg, Nature Spirits Egg).
